# Solidity Integer Overflow

In Solidity, an integer overflow occurs when the result of an arithmetic operation is too large to be stored in the assigned data type. Solidity integers have a fixed size and a defined range of values that they can represent. 

For example, the `uint8` data type can store values between 0 and 255, but any value larger than 255 will result in an overflow. When an overflow occurs, the result wraps around and becomes a value within the defined range. 

This can lead to unintended consequences and security vulnerabilities in smart contracts. For example, a contract that calculates the balance of an account might overflow and report a balance that is much smaller than the actual value. 

To avoid overflows and ensure the security of your smart contracts, it's important to use the appropriate data type and perform overflow checks in your code.
