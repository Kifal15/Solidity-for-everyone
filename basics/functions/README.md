# Functions

Functions are simply a collection of set of rules and conditions used as a single codebase.

* Solidity Function Syntax *

Use the following syntax to create your Solidity function, as seen in the example below:

- Define the function with the function keyword
- Create a name for the function, which is unique and does not coincide with any of the reserved keywords
- List any parameters containing the name and data type of the parameter or include no extra parameters
- Create a statement block surrounded by curly brackets
